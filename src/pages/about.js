      <h1>Junior Software Engineer</h1>
      <p>I’m a junior web developer and designer. I'm passionate about creating usable digital products that inspires people to live their 'best' lives. I’ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered web design/UX, I realized it would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code.</p>
